The first programming project involves writing a program that evaluates infix expressions of unsigned integers using two stacks. The program should consist of three classes. The main class should create a GUI that allows the user input an infix expression and displays the result. The GUI should look as follows:

<img decoding="async" data-recalc-dims="1" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ankitcodinghub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/939.png?w=980&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==">

 </noscript>The GUI must be generated by code that you write. You may not use a drag-and-drop GUI generator.

The second class should contain the code to perform the infix expression evaluation. The pseudocode for performing that evaluation is shown below:

tokenize the string containing the expression while there are more tokens  get the next token       if it is an operand           push it onto the operand stack  else if it is a left parenthesis       push it onto the operator stack      else if it is a right parenthesis            while top of the operator stack not a left parenthesis            pop two operands and an operator                perform the calculation              push the result onto the operand stack

else if it is an operator

while the operator stack is not empty and              the operator at the top of the stack has higher            or the same precedence than the current operator              pop two operands and perform the calculation            push the result onto the operand stack          push the current operator on the operators stack while the operator stack is not empty    pop two operands and an operator  perform the calculation       push the result onto the operand stack the final result is a the top of the operand stack

Be sure to add any additional methods needed to eliminate any duplication of code.

Your program is only expected to perform correctly on syntactically correct infix expressions that contain integer operands and the four arithmetic operators + â€“ * /. It should not, however, require spaces between tokens. The usual precedence rules apply. The division performed should be integer division. A check should be made for division by zero. Should the expression contain division by zero, a checked exception DivideByZero should be thrown by the method that performs the evaluation and caught in the main class, where a JOptionPane window should be displayed containing an error message.
